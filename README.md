# Download

You can download InboxPager from the free and open-source F-Droid app store.

[<img src="https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png" alt="Get it on F-Droid" height="80">](https://f-droid.org/packages/net.inbox.pager/)

# Usage

In order to use this application, you have to enable SSL/TLS application-email-checking through your email account's web interface. Some email servers may have this feature already turned on (NOT GMAIL!, see below). If your account's server does not support this feature, this app won't work.

You can set up an account in InboxPager by going to "Settings" > "Add Account". There you have to enter your account's credentials and server parameters. If you don't know what your email account's server parameters are, use the automatic tools provided to find out, or enter and test your own configuration. Optionally, if you'd like to receive a sound or vibration notification, tick those settings. If you wish to have a specific account refresh only when you want it to, untick the "Allow in all-accounts-refresh" in that account's settings.

By default InboxPager DOES <b>NOT</b> KEEP "FULL MESSAGE" copies of emails. It just downloads the main textual contents of the message. If you wish to change this policy, you can do this in the settings for an individual account. Keeping full messages can consume your device's internal memory very quickly. In order to save emails, the full message must first be downloaded into the internal database. Also, unless the full email message is already inside the internal database, downloading attachments will require access to the internet.

# Features

The app can:

- Animate a smooth transition between visual contexts.

- Automatically convert texts from their declared character encoding to UTF-8. 

- Download your full email messages (with attachments inside).

- Download an individual attachment.

- Display server certificates used in the last connection.

- Keep track of your unread messages.

- Notify with sound of new messages (per user choice).

- Notify with device vibration of new messages (per user choice).

- Work with OpenPGP messages.

- Verify hostnames (if self-signed certificates aren't available).

# Permissions

InboxPager uses android permissions on the local device for the following reasons:

ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, INTERNET:

Communication with user defined message servers. Downloading/Uploading messages.

VIBRATE:

Device can be made to vibrate, if new messages have arrived. Users can disable this setting from inside the application.

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:

In order to save messages, or attachments, to the device.

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:

In order to send messages with attachments.

## Requirements

In general - a network connection that does not implement (small) download quotas.

For a POP (Post Office Protocol 3) mail server:

- Support for the extensions "TOP", "SASL", and "UIDL".

- LOTS of internal phone memory.

## Known Items

If there are any errors in the application, you should be able to see those in the internal application Event Log. For data leak prevention, this log is automatically deleted if the app is closed or crashes. The crashes should be visible in android's log (logcat).

- If you experience errors while downloading a large attachment, close some other applications to get more RAM.

- Message and attachment sizes are always only an approximation.

- POP has no way to know if a message has been previously seen.

- Seen messages can not become unseen twice.

- Sent messages are not saved locally inside the app; most servers will save those automatically on the server.

- Device orientation is frozen during sending and downloading to prevent crashing. This is restored when finished.

- IF YOU DOWNLOAD TOO MANY ATTACHMENTS TOO QUICKLY, your server may ban you. Download the full message and save them afterwards.

- Message dates (>=v5.1) are reformatted and converted to the LOCAL DEVICE TIMEZONE. Press "DATE", to see converted datetime header in a widget. Press the text of the date, to see the original raw datetime.

## WON'T FIX

- Automatically, on a cloud server, Save/Restore internal database. If a backup of the local device is necessary, close the app and copy/paste the database from "/data/data/...".

- Backend that runs in the background, as a constantly present service.

- Contacts integration with the rest of the Android OS.

- Forwarding messages (digests) from inside the app.

- Full IMAP folders. The app is "lite".

- Ordinary non-SSL/TLS. This includes (STARTTLS).

- Printing messages on paper. You can save them to file and print them manually.

- Automatic inclusion of the message being replied to in the new message.

# Gmail Configuration

Requires Two Factor Authentication (2FA).

Make sure you have enabled IMAP access in Google Account.

To use a Gmail inbox, you need to setup an App Password.

1. Login to Gmail.
2. To enable App Passwords for you google account, you need to have Two Factor Authentication (2FA).
3. In GMail > Security > App Passwords.
4. [IMPORTANT STEP] Press Select app > Other (Custom name)
5. Give it a name. Done.
6. Enter the letters (without spaces!) as password.

App Password:

- ONLY 16 symbols.
- REVOKED (or disabled) when you CHANGE you Gmail PASSWORD. Set it again in GMail > Security > App Passwords.
- to be CHANGED regularly, IF you WANT any SECURITY at all!

The other Gmail account settings are: 

Username: user.name@gmail.com

Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server: imap.gmail.com

Port: 993

Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server: smtp.gmail.com

Port for SSL: 465

Sometimes checking Gmail too often (<10 minutes) can cause blocked application access to an account.

If you are using POP with Gmail, make sure to enable it from Gmail's settings web interface via browser first.

# Cryptography / Privacy / Security

## Text Block Encryption

The text of the message you send and/or receive can be encrypted/decrypted with either AES or Twofish cryptography. This WILL NOT ENCRYPT your message attachments. [For attachments encryption use OpenPGP.] Encrypting the texts with AES or Twofish makes it easy to send simple text message emails with minimal setup. All you need is a passphrase (a key), that both the sender and receiver already know. Although it should be technically possible to encrypt with an empty passphrase, it's a bad practice. The passphrase must be no longer than 32 symbols (=256bits). If the passphrase length is less than 32, then extra symbols (called padding) are automatically added. You can choose the type of padding to be PKCS7Padding or TBC. Additionally, you can also select the type of block encryption mode - CBC/CTR/ECB/ICM/OFB. The best privacy and security is when you encrypt your text with Block encryption, and then also with OpenPGP.

The procedure for block text encryption/decryption is simple. Select some text, a context menu appears, press encrypt/decrypt as applicable. See images below.

## OpenPGP Usage

In order to use cryptographic services, you need to install an app called OpenKeychain and make, or import, some pgp-keys. OpenKeychain applies OpenPGP privacy/security to a given message, and the process is described below, or (better) just look at the screenshots. Sending inline messages in non-pgp/mime standard is not supported, but third party apps exist that can do that through the system clipboard buffer.

IMPORTANT, for BCC messages:

Encrypted blocks may show the ids of the recipients' encryption keys. This may leak data if you're using the blind carbon copy (BCC) message property. For example: a message is encrypted, Alice sends to Bob and Carol; Carol is a BCC, but Carol may also see the key id of Bob.

### Signed Clear Text

Signing a clear, unencrypted message with a pgp key that will be sent using pgp/mime. This option is for those who want to be sure that a message was produced with a certain pgp key, but the message contents are not encrypted. It can include attachments.

1. Click the padlock icon, this starts the pgp implementation.

2. Choose "Sign clear text message" spinner.

3. Pick a signing key by pressing on the text button.

4. Ignore recipient keys.

5. Click "GPG"; that produces the pgp/mime.

6. Click "READY"; that returns you to the sending activity.

7. Press "SEND".

Some email clients may complain of a "bad signature" (i.e. Thunderbird with Enigmail). Manually checking the signature against the firts pgp/mime part with "gpg --verify signature.asc message.txt" is one solution.

### Encrypt Message

Encrypting a message, or signing and encrypting a message. This option is for those that desire more privacy for their content (for example: commercial organizations). Messages produced with this option will be encrypted, and they can optionally be signed. [Extra: If one wishes to be able to decrypt their own messages for posterity, use the option to add the signing key to the recipients. Can include attachments.]

1. Click the padlock icon; this starts the pgp implementation.

2. Choose "Encrypt" or "Sing and encrypt" from spinner.

3. Pick a signing key by pressing on the text button.

4. Pick the recipient keys by pressing on the text button.

5. Click "GPG", that produces the pgp/mime.

6. Click "READY", that returns you to the sending activity.

7. Press "SEND".

### Decrypt or Verify Message

Decrypt a pgp/mime message and/or only verifying the signature validity. Can save attachemnts.

1. Click the padlock icon, this starts the pgp implementation.

2. Click "GPG", that produces the pgp/mime.

3. Click "READY", that returns you to the message activity.

4. Clicking on the icon near the padlock displays signature verification.

5. Clicking on the attachment image button from the top now produces decrypted attachments.
